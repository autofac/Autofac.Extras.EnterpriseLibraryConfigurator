[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3o5xlwu9t8on7oue?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/Autofac/autofac-extras-enterpriselibraryconfigurator)

**Note: This package is only for EntLib 5.** Enterprise Library 6 was updated so it no longer requires an integration package and is decoupled from dependency injection.

Please file issues and pull requests for this package in this repository rather than in the Autofac core repo.
